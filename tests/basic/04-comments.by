print 'first line'  # <-- first line that is actually printed


#(
	This is a multiline comment (parenthesis in(side) here are balanced)
)

#((
	Since parenthesis are balanced, you can start with any number!
))

#(((
	This style is more balanced, if it strikes your fancy.	
#)))

#(
	As ugly as this is, it will actually be printed:
)print 'second line'

# (
#   This style of comment allows easily toggling sections of code by
#   adding or removing a space before the parenthesis!

print 'third line'    # this is printed as long as the space is there

#   This would be the end of the disabled section!
# )

print '# this is not a comment'
